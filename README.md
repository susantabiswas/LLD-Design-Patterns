Design Patterns in C++

## Creational Patterns

### 1. Factory Method

It is a design pattern which can be used in scenarios where we are dealing with creation of an object.
Suppose we are dealing with products of certian kind, e.g., wooden objects. Now we can have wooden chairs, tables, doors etc and each can have variety of models.

**Another Use Case**

When we want to control object creation, let's say we have limited resources and want to only have certain no. of objects. Then using a factory, we can reuse released objects and ensure that only certain no. of objects are in existence.
